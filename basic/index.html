  <a href="https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js">RSVP.js</a> provides simple tools for organizing asynchronous code
  (you should peruse the readme doc there first).
  <h1>A Basic Promise</h1>
  <button id="resolveBtn">Resolve</button>
  <button id="rejectBtn">Reject</button>
  <br/>
  <div id="output"></div>
  <p>
    This illustrates a promise at its most basic.  Your promise wraps your async code in a function which
    supplies <strong>resolve</strong> and <strong>reject</strong> parameters.  When your async code returns
    in the correct way, you call <strong>resolve(someMsg)</strong>.  You supply someMsg - if you were
    getting json, you'd probably return that.
  </p>
  <p>
    If your async code errors, you call <strong>reject(someErrorMsg)</strong>, passing back error
    info of your choosing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Resolving or rejecting a promise results in a callback to <strong>then()</strong> which has takes
    two functions as parameters, the first for the resolved case, and the second for the rejected case.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the async event is a button click.
  </p>
  <pre>
    var promise = new <strong>RSVP.Promise</strong>(function(<strong>resolve, reject</strong>){

      $(document).on("click", "#resolveBtn", function(){
        reportStatus(promise)
        <strong>resolve</strong>("resolving!")
      });

      $(document).on("click", "#rejectBtn", function(){
        reportStatus(promise)
        <strong>reject</strong>("rejecting!")
      });
    });

    promise.<strong>then</strong>(
      function(msg){
        outputMsg("Then(resolved) Msg: " + msg)
      },
      function(err){
        outputMsg("Then(rejected) Err: " + err)
      }
    )
  </pre>
  <p>
    Try clicking the buttons multiple times.  Note that the then callbacks are not called.  This
    is because once a promise is resolved or rejected, it remains in that state and no longer fires
    callbacks.  You can, however, can then() multiple times as will be shown in the next example...
